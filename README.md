### Surface
The main targeted users of this website are families with kids, so I wanted to use colors and fonts that represent warmth, happiness, friendliness, and firmness.
  - __Logo__

    There are 3 main colors using in this website:

### Unfixed Bugs
This is an incomplete project, so there are still tons of unfixed bugs.

My top priority when I have a chance to work on this again would be responsiveness. Maybe I should revamp the whole website's layout.
